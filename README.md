# SE-Assignment-2
Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:

Software engineering is simply applying the knowlegde of programming languages to design , develop and maintain computer application in order to come up with solutions to real world problems.

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?

software engineering involves a more organised process that involves designing, developing, testing,creating and maintaining quality, reliable computer applications to solve real life issues, while, traditional programming involved writing codes to solve specific problems. 


Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.

phase 1: planning and requirement analysis which involves:defining project scope, setting objectives and goals,and resource planning
phase 2: design which involves system architect user interface and user experience designing
phase 3: development involving front end and back end developer
phase 4: testing involving identifying and fixing bugs
phase 5: deployment involving realising the software to the user
phase 6: maintainance where any arising issue is fixed and the software updated over time.


Agile vs. Waterfall Models:

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?

Agile model is open to adptation and allows changes in later phases of the project hence flexible compared to waterfall model that is rigid hence suitable for projects with defined end goals.


Requirements Engineering:

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.

requirement engineering is simply the process of defining, documenting,and managing requirements in the design process.

process of requirement engineering:
1. Elicitation that includes gathering requirement from stake holders through interviews, workshops, and document aanlysis.
2. analysis that ensures completeness and consistency that identifies conflicts enabling feasibility.
3. specification that documents requirement in a clear manner.
4. validity ensures the stakeholders meet the project's goals.
5. management takes care of the changing nature of requirements.


Software Design Principles:

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?

modularity is a design principle that subdivides a system into smaller independent parts called modules which can be created ,modified, replaced, exchanged with other modules without affecting other modules.

it improves maintainability since it is easier to understand and debug as each module is on a single responsibity.
it improves scalability as new features can br implemented by  creatng new models without rewriting the existing code.


Testing in Software Engineering:

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?

1. unit testing-  They consist in testing individual methods and functions of the classes, components, or modules used by your software. bugs are detected early hence faster and cheaper fixes
2. intergration testing- Ensures different modules or components work together seamlessly as a whole. For example, it can be testing the interaction with the database or making sure that microservices work together as expected. 
3. system testing- ensures the system meets its functional and non-functional requirements before deployment.
4. acceptance testing- They require the entire application to be running while testing and focus on replicating user behaviors.

it's benefits include:
-Testing helps identify and fix issues before they reach end-users.
-Improves User Experience by ensuring features work as intended.
-Testing helps identify and address security vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers.
-significantly enhances the quality and reliability of the software.


Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.

version control is the practice of tracking and managing changes to software code.

importance of version controlls include:
- keeps track of every modification to the code in a special kind of database. 
-helps developers move faster and allows software teams to preserve efficiency and agility as the team scales to include more developers.
-A complete long-term change history of every file where  You can revert to previous versions of the codebase if something goes wrong.

popular versions control systems include:
1. Git: VCS favored for its flexibility, offline capabilities.
2. Mercurial : is known for its speed and ease of branching, making it a good option for smaller teams.
3. HelixCore:It offers the sole source of accuracy for all development.


Software Project Management:

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
-Project Leader: Sets the direction, defines goals, and creates the project plan.
-Risk Mitigator: Proactively identifies and addresses potential issues that could derail the project.
-Delegating project tasks to team members.
-Creating the project plan and schedule.
-Recruiting project staff.


Software Maintenance:

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?

Software maintenance is the ongoing process of modifying and updating software after it's been deployed.

different types of maintainance activities include:
-Future-proofing: Taking preventative measures to avoid problems.
-Corrective Maintenance: Focuses on fixing bugs and errors that arise in the software after deployment.
-Adaptive Maintenance: Making changes to the software to adapt to a new environment or evolving user needs. 

importance of maintainance include:
-fixes bugs making the software run smoothly.
-Improves User Experience: Addresses usability issues and enhances user satisfaction.
-Protects against security threats by updating the software to address security and protect user data.
-Keeps Up with Changes: Adapts the software to evolving technologies, user needs, or regulations.


Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?

- job displacement and automation 
- Unintentional security vulnerabilities can leave software susceptible to attacks. 
- Algorithmic Bias.
 
 software engineers can adhere to ethical standards by: 
 - Staying informed about ethical issues in software development and understanding relevant codes of conduct.
 - Accountability: Taking responsibility for the software they create and its potential impact on society.
 - Speaking up against unethical practices and advocating for responsible software development.
